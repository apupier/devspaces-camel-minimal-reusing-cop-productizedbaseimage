# Minimal example for Camel standalone in OpenShift Dev Spaces

This repository shows the minimal setup to have OpenShift Dev spaces setup with capabilities to create, edit graphically or textually, run, debug and deploy a standalone Camel Yaml route.

After opening the repository in Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces, wait for all extensions to be installed. You can notice that it is mentioning `installing` during this waiting phase.

It is based on a Red Hat productized image, be sure that you have the right to use it.
